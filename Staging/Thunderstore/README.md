Adds portals to BONELAB, with proper momentum conservation and stereoscopic rendering.

# IMPORTANT
This code mod does not contain the ability to spawn the portals. You must install both the [Portal Effects Resource and Portal Gun mods](https://mod.io/g/bonelab/c/portal-dependencies) in order to interact with portals.

These are both regular SDK mods, meaning you can download them to your SDK mods folder or by subscribing to them and clicking Download All in-game, but it cannot be downloaded to your MelonLoader/LemonLoader mods folder!

# CAVEATS
Implementing Portals comes with a lot of nuances and potential jank. Some of the issues you may occasionally encounter are:
- Performance Issues
- Collision Issues
- Rendering Issues

# BONEMENU SUPPORT
In BoneMenu, you can toggle a few different settings for performance:
- Render View - Toggles rendering through the portal.
- Render Scale - Changes the resolution of the inside of the portal.
- Render Volumetrics - Changes whether or not volumetrics render inside the portal, for performance.
- Limit Distance - Enables the Render Distance option.
- Render Distance - Controls how far away you can be from the portal before it stops rendering the view.
- Max Recursion - The maximum amount of times you can see portals through each other before they stop rendering the view.
- Disable in Fusion - Prevents the spawning of portals while in a Fusion lobby.
